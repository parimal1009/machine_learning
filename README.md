Supervised Regression and Classification Models
This repository contains various supervised regression and classification models implemented in Python. The purpose is to provide a structured collection of different models along with practice examples to understand their workings, usage, and performance evaluation techniques.

Regression Models
Linear Regression: Simple and multiple linear regression with various evaluation metrics.
Polynomial Regression: Regression to handle non-linear relationships between variables.
Ridge and Lasso Regression: Regularization techniques to handle multicollinearity and reduce overfitting.
Elastic Net Regression: Combines both Lasso and Ridge regularizations.
Robust Regression: Techniques to handle outliers in the data.

Classification Models
Logistic Regression: Binary and multiclass classification using logistic regression.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Classification using SVM with linear and non-linear kernels.
Decision Trees: Training and visualization of decision trees for classification tasks.
Random Forest: Ensemble learning method combining multiple decision trees.
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN): Classification based on the closest neighbors.
Gradient Boosting: Advanced ensemble method for classification.
